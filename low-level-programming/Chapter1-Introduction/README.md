INTRODUCTION

WHAT IS A C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE!

C is a general-purpose and procedural programming language.

A procedural language is a type of programming language that follows a step-by-step approach to solving a problem.

It uses a series of instructions, otherwise known as procedures or functions, that are executed in a specific order to perform tasks and accomplish goals. These intructions tell the computer step by step what to do and in what order.


C is a compiled programming language, like Go, Java, Swift, and Rust.

Compiled languages are different from interpeted languages, such as PHP, Ruby, Python, and JavaScript.

The difference between compiled and interpeted languages is that a compiled language is directly translated to machine code all at once.

This process is done by a special program called a compiler.

The compiler reads the entire source code, checks it for errors, and then translates the entire program into machine code. This is a language the computer can understand and it's directly associated with the particular instructions of the computer.

This process creates a standalone binary executable file containing sequences of 0s and 1s which is a more computer-friendly form of the initial source code. This file contains instructions that the computer can understand and run directly.

An interpeted language, on the other hand, doesn’t get translated into machine code all at once and doesn’t produce a binary executable file.

Instead, an interpreter reads and executes the source code one instruction at a time, line by line. The interpreter reads each line, translates it into machine code, and then immediately runs it.


What Are Header Files in C?
Let’s start with the first line, #include <stdio.h>.

The #include part of #include <stdio.h> is a preprocessor command that tells the C compiler to include a file.

Specifically, it tells the compiler to include the stdio.h header file.

Header files are external libraries.

This means that some developers have written some functionality and features that are not included at the core of the C language.

By adding header files to your code, you get additional functionality that you can use in your programs without having to write the code from scratch.

The stdio.h header file stands for standard input-output.

It contains function definitions for input and output operations, such as functions for gathering user data and printing data to the console.

Specifically, it provides functions such as printf() and scanf().




            SECTION 2

    VARIABLES!!

Variables store different kind of data in the computer's memory, and take up a certain amount of space.

Data types specify the type of form that information can have in C programs. And they determine what kind of operations can be performed on that information.
